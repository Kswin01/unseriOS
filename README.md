# unseriOS

This is a rather unserious operating system written for fun. Mostly going to be taking inspiration from
osdev wiki and seL4 (although I am ***definitely*** not going to implement a capability system).

Mostly just a learning exercise for me to revisit alot of kernel concepts that I have not had the
chance to touch since my undergraduate coursework.
